# FloodRisk_Predictor_Assam
"This model predicts flood risk in Assam using classification-based machine learning on historical rainfall data."

# What this project is about
I used rainfall data from 1901 to 2017.
Trained a machine learning model to classify flood risk.
Finds important factors affecting floods.
Optimizes model performance with Hyperparameter Tuning.

# How to implement
Open the .ipynb file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
Run the code step by step.
The model will classify flood risk for different years based on rainfall.
Check model accuracy and predictions.

# Dataset
The dataset contains monthly & annual rainfall data of Assam from 1901 to 1907.
Columns include: Year, Monthly Rainfall (Jan-Dec), Annual Rainfall, Latitude & Longitude
